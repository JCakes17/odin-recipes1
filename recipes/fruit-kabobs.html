<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A refreshing summer dessert to go with whatever else you are grilling.</p>

<h3>Ingedients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>half a cup of butter or margarine</li>
        <li>quarter cup of honey</li>
        <li>3 fresh peaches, pitted and quartered</li>
        <li>3 fresh plums, pitted and quartered</li>
        <li>3 bananas, cut into 4 pieces each</li>
        <li>12 strawberries, hulled</li>
        <li>12 skewers</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and place a large sheet of foil onto the grate.</li>
        <li>Melt butter and honey together in a small saucepan over medium heat. Reduce heat to low and cook gently, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Do not let the sauce boil.</li>
        <li>Thread a peach quarter, a plum quarter, a banana piece, and a strawberry onto each skewer. Place the skewers onto the foil on the preheated grill; spoon honey mixture over each skewer.</li>
        <li>Grill until the fruit is softened and the sauce has thickened and cooked onto the fruit, about 5 minutes. Flip the skewers, spoon more margarine-honey sauce over each, and grill for about 5 more minutes on the other side.</li>
    </ol>
